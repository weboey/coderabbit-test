# AI Investment Strategy Backtesting System

An intelligent backtesting system that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate, test, and iteratively improve investment strategies based on technical analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Strategy Generation**: Uses GPT-4 to create investment strategies based on market data analysis
- **Comprehensive Backtesting**: Realistic portfolio simulation with transaction costs and slippage
- **Iterative Improvement**: AI learns from performance feedback to generate better strategies
- **Technical Analysis**: 15+ technical indicators including RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and more
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics including Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win rate, and custom scoring
- **User-Friendly Interface**: CLI application with interactive and command-line modes
- **Session Management**: Save and load backtesting sessions for later analysis

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Internet connection for stock data retrieval

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backtestai
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python main.py
```

### Command Line Mode
```bash
# Analyze AAPL with default settings
python main.py AAPL

# Custom parameters
python main.py TSLA --iterations 5 --target-score 75
```

### Test the System
```bash
python test_system.py
```

## 📊 Example Usage

```python
from core.orchestrator import AIBacktestOrchestrator

# Initialize the system
orchestrator = AIBacktestOrchestrator()

# Run backtesting session
results = orchestrator.run_backtesting_session(
    ticker="AAPL",
    max_iterations=3,
    target_score=80.0
)

# View results
if results['success']:
    print(results['session_summary'])
    best_strategy = results['best_strategy']
    best_performance = results['best_performance']
```

### Key Components

1. **Data Provider** (`data/`): Fetches stock data using yfinance and calculates technical indicators
2. **LLM Integration** (`llm/`): Handles OpenAI API communication, prompt engineering, and response parsing
3. **Strategy Engine** (`strategy/`): Represents investment strategies and generates trading signals
4. **Backtesting Engine** (`backtesting/`): Simulates portfolio performance with realistic costs
5. **Orchestrator** (`core/`): Coordinates the entire iterative improvement process

## 📈 Technical Indicators

The system uses 15+ technical indicators for strategy generation:

- **Moving Averages**: SMA_20, SMA_50, EMA_12, EMA_26
- **Momentum**: RSI, MACD, MACD_signal, momentum
- **Volatility**: Bollinger Bands (upper, middle, lower), ATR, volatility
- **Volume**: Volume SMA, volume ratio
- **Price**: Price change, price position

## 🎯 Performance Metrics

- **Returns**: Total return, annualized return, excess return over buy & hold
- **Risk**: Volatility, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio
- **Trading**: Number of trades, win rate, profit factor, time in market
- **Scoring**: Custom performance score (0-100) with weighted metrics

## 🔧 Configuration

Key configuration options in `config/settings.py`:

```python
# Backtesting
INITIAL_CAPITAL = 100000.0    # Starting capital
TRANSACTION_COST = 0.001      # 0.1% per trade
SLIPPAGE = 0.0005            # 0.05% slippage

# Strategy
MAX_POSITION_SIZE = 0.3       # Max 30% per position
MIN_POSITION_SIZE = 0.05      # Min 5% per position

# AI
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4-turbo-preview"
MAX_TOKENS = 2000
TEMPERATURE = 0.7
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_system.py
```

Tests cover:
- Strategy creation and signal generation
- Portfolio simulation accuracy
- Performance evaluation metrics
- LLM response parsing
- System integration
